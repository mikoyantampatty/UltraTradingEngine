# UltraTradingEngine – AI‑Powered Multi‑Strategy Forex Trading Bot

## Overview
UltraTradingEngine is a personal Forex trading system developed entirely from scratch by **a 52‑year‑old part‑time driver in Indonesia with no formal education or engineering background**.  
By learning Python, MetaTrader5 API, and trading logic little by little, this project grew into a fully‑automated multi‑strategy bot.

The engine coordinates several strategies in parallel and executes orders through the MetaTrader5 Python API.  
It combines:

- **Multi‑Timeframe Scalping** – short‑term trading from M1 → H4, using majority‑trend confirmation  
- **Whale Volatility Filter** – lot adaptation when volatility spikes  
- **Dynamic Lot Scaling** – adjusts lot sizes by free margin and risk consistency  
- **Pair‑Specific Optimization** – special parameters for GOLD#, BTCUSD#, etc.  
- **Parallel Multi‑Strategy Core** – Mean Reversion, Breakout, Intraday Swing, Trend Following EMA  
- **AI Bandit Integration** – reinforcement‑learning layer to fine‑tune confidence scores

## Technical Architecture


### Flow
1. **Symbol Resolution** – verifies `.env` pairs against broker instrument list (handles XM suffix `#`).  
2. **Data Loading** – retrieves OHLCV data using `mt5.copy_rates_from_pos()`.  
3. **Signal Generation** – each strategy produces a signal and confidence score.  
4. **Decision Fusion** – chooses strongest signal or runs multiple in parallel if valid.  
5. **Order Execution** – sends MT5 orders, logs results, updates daily & weekly performance.

## Key Features
- Works with broker‑specific symbol naming (e.g., `USDJPY#`, `GOLD#`, `.micro`).  
- Confidence‑gate avoids low‑probability trades.  
- AI‑adjusted decision layer powered by a simple bandit reinforcement model.  
- Built‑in risk consistency manager scaling exposure based on drawdown history.

## Current Challenges
- Some XM broker symbols return `trade disabled` via API although active in Market Watch.  
- Need automatic detection of tradeable symbols and dynamic `.env` update.  
- Funding required for further live testing and maintaining development tools.
