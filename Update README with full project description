# UltraTradingEngine – AI‑Powered Multi‑Strategy Forex Trading Bot

## Overview
UltraTradingEngine is a personal Forex trading system developed entirely from scratch by **a 52‑year‑old part‑time driver in Indonesia with no formal education or engineering background**.  
By learning Python, MetaTrader5 API, and trading logic little by little, this project grew into a fully‑automated multi‑strategy bot.

The engine coordinates several strategies in parallel and executes orders through the MetaTrader5 Python API.  
It combines:

- **Multi‑Timeframe Scalping** – short‑term trading from M1 → H4, using majority‑trend confirmation  
- **Whale Volatility Filter** – lot adaptation when volatility spikes  
- **Dynamic Lot Scaling** – adjusts lot sizes by free margin and risk consistency  
- **Pair‑Specific Optimization** – special parameters for GOLD#, BTCUSD#, etc.  
- **Parallel Multi‑Strategy Core** – Mean Reversion, Breakout, Intraday Swing, Trend Following EMA  
- **AI Bandit Integration** – reinforcement‑learning layer to fine‑tune confidence scores

## Technical Architecture


### Flow
1. **Symbol Resolution** – verifies `.env` pairs against broker instrument list (handles XM suffix `#`).  
2. **Data Loading** – retrieves OHLCV data using `mt5.copy_rates_from_pos()`.  
3. **Signal Generation** – each strategy produces a signal and confidence score.  
4. **Decision Fusion** – chooses strongest signal or runs multiple in parallel if valid.  
5. **Order Execution** – sends MT5 orders, logs results, updates daily & weekly performance.

## Key Features
- Works with broker‑specific symbol naming (e.g., `USDJPY#`, `GOLD#`, `.micro`).  
- Confidence‑gate avoids low‑probability trades.  
- AI‑adjusted decision layer powered by a simple bandit reinforcement model.  
- Built‑in risk consistency manager scaling exposure based on drawdown history.

## Current Challenges
- Some XM broker symbols return `trade disabled` via API although active in Market Watch.  
- Need automatic detection of tradeable symbols and dynamic `.env` update.  
- Funding required for further live testing and maintaining development tools.

## Example Issue – Averaging Logic Not Triggering
A current difficulty appears in live demo trading, especially with symbols containing the "#" suffix.  
When the system opens an initial BUY position and the candle immediately turns bearish,  
the averaging logic should trigger: hold the BUY but simultaneously open a SELL position.  
This counter‑position would allow the bot to profit regardless of candle direction.  

However, in the current build the averaging module does not trigger correctly,  
so the bot holds only the BUY trades. This causes losses when price reverses sharply.  
Fixing this behavior and ensuring averaging activates under the correct conditions is a primary goal for upcoming updates.

## Example Issue – Inconsistent Trade Availability on Forex Pairs
Another issue occurs with certain Forex pairs configured in `.env`.  
Some symbols are fully visible and active in Market Watch,  
but the MetaTrader5 Python API returns "trade disabled" when attempting to open trades.  

This is inconsistent: some pairs trade perfectly, others fail despite being active.  
Investigation is required to determine whether this is a broker‑side restriction,  
a symbol‑suffix mismatch (e.g., `EURGBP#` or `.micro`), or an MT5 server configuration issue.  
A robust auto‑detection and filtering mechanism is planned to prevent the bot from selecting non‑tradeable symbols.

## Future Vision – Toward an AI‑Driven Trading System

The ultimate goal of **UltraTradingEngine** is to evolve into a fully‑autonomous trading system powered by **real artificial intelligence and machine learning**.  
When sufficient resources become available, several upgrades are planned:

1. **Deep Learning Integration** – incorporate reinforcement and recurrent neural‑network models to detect high‑probability setups.
2. **Deep Thinking Layer** – decision‑tree based reasoning that evaluates multiple market contexts before placing any order.
3. **Continuous Data Collection & Retraining** – build a long‑term dataset of tick data, indicators, and decision outcomes to constantly retrain the models.
4. **Risk‑Adaptive Engine** – dynamically adjust exposure and strategy choice according to confidence metrics from the AI models.
5. **Cloud‑Native Infrastructure** – move execution and retraining to scalable cloud services to handle larger datasets and faster back‑testing.

This vision represents a move from rule‑based algorithmic trading toward a truly intelligent, self‑improving trading system built in Indonesia from limited resources but with limitless determination.
